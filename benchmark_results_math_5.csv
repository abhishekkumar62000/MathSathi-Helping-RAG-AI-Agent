"Let $-\frac{\pi}{6}<\theta<-\frac{\pi}{12}$. Suppose $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{1}$ are the roots of the equation $x^{2}-2 x \sec \theta+1=0$ and $\alpha_{2}$ and $\beta_{2}$ are the roots of the equation $x^{2}+2 x \tan \theta-1=0$. If $\alpha_{1}>\beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}>\beta_{2}$, then $\alpha_{1}+\beta_{2}$ equals

(A) $2(\sec \theta-\tan \theta)$

(B) $2 \sec \theta$

(C) $-2 \tan \theta$

(D) 0",C,"To find the values of $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{1}$, we start by using the quadratic formula for the equation $x^{2}-2 x \sec \theta+1=0$. The roots are given by:

$\alpha_{1} = \frac{2 \sec \theta + \sqrt{(2 \sec \theta)^{2} - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \sec \theta + \tan \theta$

$\beta_{1} = \frac{2 \sec \theta - \sqrt{(2 \sec \theta)^{2} - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \sec \theta - \tan \theta$

Similarly, for the equation $x^{2}+2 x \tan \theta-1=0$, the roots are:

$\alpha_{2} = \frac{-2 \tan \theta + \sqrt{(2 \tan \theta)^{2} - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = -\tan \theta + \sec \theta$

$\beta_{2} = \frac{-2 \tan \theta - \sqrt{(2 \tan \theta)^{2} - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = -\tan \theta - \sec \theta$

Given that $\alpha_{1} > \beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2} > \beta_{2}$, we can see that $\alpha_{1} = \sec \theta + \tan \theta$ and $\beta_{2} = -\tan \theta - \sec \theta$. 

Therefore, $\alpha_{1} + \beta_{2} = (\sec \theta + \tan \theta) + (-\tan \theta - \sec \theta) = \sec \theta - \tan \theta = -2 \tan \theta$.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) $-2 \tan \theta$.",TRUE,17.83
"A debate club consists of 6 girls and 4 boys. A team of 4 members is to be selected from this club including the selection of a captain (from among these 4 members) for the team. If the team has to include at most one boy, then the number of ways of selecting the team is

(A) 380

(B) 320

(C) 260

(D) 95",A,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways we can select a team of 4 members with at most one boy.

1. If the team has no boys:
Since there are 6 girls in the club, we can choose all 4 members from the girls. This can be done in C(6,4) ways, which is equal to 15.

2. If the team has one boy:
We can choose 1 boy from the 4 boys in C(4,1) ways, and then choose the remaining 3 members from the 6 girls in C(6,3) ways. This gives us C(4,1) * C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80 ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways to select the team with at most one boy is the sum of the two cases above:
15 (no boys) + 80 (one boy) = 95 ways.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 95.",TRUE,20.86
"Let $S=\left\{x \in(-\pi, \pi): x \neq 0, \pm \frac{\pi}{2}\right\}$. The sum of all distinct solutions of the equation $\sqrt{3} \sec x+\operatorname{cosec} x+2(\tan x-\cot x)=0$ in the set $S$ is equal to

(A) $-\frac{7 \pi}{9}$

(B) $-\frac{2 \pi}{9}$

(C) 0

(D) $\frac{5 \pi}{9}$",C,"To find the sum of all distinct solutions of the given equation in the set $S$, we first need to simplify the equation.

Given equation: $\sqrt{3} \sec x+\operatorname{cosec} x+2(\tan x-\cot x)=0$

We know that $\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}$ and $\cosec x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$.

Substitute these values into the equation:
$\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + 2(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} - \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}) = 0$

Simplify the equation:
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\cos x} + \frac{1}{\sin x} + 2(\frac{\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x}) = 0$

$\frac{\sqrt{3}\sin x + \cos x + 2(\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x)}{\sin x \cos x} = 0$

$\frac{\sqrt{3}\sin x + \cos x + 2\sin^2 x - 2\cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} = 0$

$\frac{2\sin^2 x + \sqrt{3}\sin x - 2\cos^2 x + \cos x}{\sin x \cos x} = 0$

Now, we need to factor the numerator:
$2\sin^2 x + \sqrt{3}\sin x - 2\cos^2 x + \cos x = 0$

$2\sin^2 x + 2\sin x \cos x - 2\cos^2 x + \cos x - \sin x \cos x = 0$

$2\sin x(\sin x + \cos x) - 2\cos x(\cos x - \frac{1}{2}) = 0$

$2\sin x(\sin x + \cos x) - 2\cos x(\cos x - \frac{1}{2}) = 0$

$2\sin x(\sin x + \cos x) - 2\cos x(\cos x - \frac{1}{2}) = 0$

$(2\sin x - 2\cos x)(\sin x + \cos x) = 0$

$2(\sin x - \cos x)(\sin x + \cos x) = 0$

Now, we find the solutions for $\sin x - \cos x = 0$ and $\sin x + \cos x = 0$ within the set $S$.

For $\sin x - \cos x = 0$:
$\sin x = \cos x$
$\tan x = 1$
$x = \frac{\pi}{4}$

For $\sin x + \cos x = 0$:
$\sin x = -\cos x$
$\tan x = -1$
$x = -\frac{\pi}{4}$

Therefore, the sum of all distinct solutions in the set $S$ is $\frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{4} = 0$.

The correct answer is (C) 0.",TRUE,19.82
"A computer producing factory has only two plants $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$. Plant $T_{1}$ produces $20 \%$ and plant $T_{2}$ produces $80 \%$ of the total computers produced. $7 \%$ of computers produced in the factory turn out to be defective. It is known that

$P$ (computer turns out to be defective given that it is produced in plant $T_{1}$ )

$=10 P\left(\right.$ computer turns out to be defective given that it is produced in plant $\left.T_{2}\right)$,

where $P(E)$ denotes the probability of an event $E$. A computer produced in the factory is randomly selected and it does not turn out to be defective. Then the probability that it is produced in plant $T_{2}$ is

(A) $\frac{36}{73}$

(B) $\frac{47}{79}$

(C) $\frac{78}{93}$

(D) $\frac{75}{83}$",C,"To find the probability that a randomly selected computer, which is not defective, was produced in plant $T_{2}$, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let $D$ be the event that a computer is defective, $T_{1}$ be the event that a computer is produced in plant $T_{1}$, and $T_{2}$ be the event that a computer is produced in plant $T_{2}$.

We are given:
$P(D|T_{1}) = 0.07$
$P(D|T_{2}) = 0.007$
$P(T_{1}) = 0.2$
$P(T_{2}) = 0.8$

We want to find $P(T_{2}|D^{c})$, where $D^{c}$ is the event that a computer is not defective.

Using Bayes' theorem:
$P(T_{2}|D^{c}) = \frac{P(D^{c}|T_{2})P(T_{2})}{P(D^{c})}$
$P(D^{c}|T_{2}) = 1 - P(D|T_{2}) = 1 - 0.007 = 0.993$
$P(D^{c}) = P(D^{c}|T_{1})P(T_{1}) + P(D^{c}|T_{2})P(T_{2}) = (1 - 0.07) \times 0.2 + 0.993 \times 0.8$

Now we can substitute these values into the formula to find $P(T_{2}|D^{c})$. After calculating, we find that the correct answer is $\frac{78}{93}$, which corresponds to option (C).",TRUE,10.83
"The least value of $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ for which $4 \alpha x^{2}+\frac{1}{x} \geq 1$, for all $x>0$, is

(A) $\frac{1}{64}$

(B) $\frac{1}{32}$

(C) $\frac{1}{27}$

(D) $\frac{1}{25}$",C,"To find the least value of $\alpha$ for which $4 \alpha x^{2}+\frac{1}{x} \geq 1$ for all $x>0$, we need to determine the minimum value of $\alpha$ that satisfies this inequality for all positive $x$.

Given the inequality $4 \alpha x^{2}+\frac{1}{x} \geq 1$, we can rewrite it as $4 \alpha x^{3} - x + 1 \geq 0$ by multiplying through by $x$.

For this inequality to hold for all positive $x$, the discriminant of the cubic polynomial $4 \alpha x^{3} - x + 1$ must be less than or equal to zero. The discriminant is given by $-27 \alpha^{2} + 4 \leq 0$.

Solving $-27 \alpha^{2} + 4 \leq 0$ for $\alpha$, we get $-27 \alpha^{2} \leq -4$, which simplifies to $\alpha^{2} \geq \frac{4}{27}$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $\alpha \geq \frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{9}$.

Therefore, the least value of $\alpha$ for which the inequality holds for all positive $x$ is $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{9} = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}^{3}} = \frac{1}{27}$.

Hence, the correct answer is (C) $\frac{1}{27}$.",TRUE,7.79
