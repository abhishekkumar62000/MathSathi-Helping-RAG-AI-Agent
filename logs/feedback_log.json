    "question": "how many arithematic operations are there in mathematics",
    "answer": "Sure! Here is a step-by-step explanation of the four basic arithmetic operations:\n\n1. Addition:\n- Addition is combining two or more numbers to find their total sum.\n- For example, if you want to add 5 and 3 together, you would write it as 5 + 3.\n- To find the sum, simply add the numbers together: 5 + 3 = 8.\n\n2. Subtraction:\n- Subtraction is taking one number away from another to find the difference.\n- For example, if you want to subtract 4 from 9, you would write it as 9 - 4.\n- To find the difference, subtract the second number from the first: 9 - 4 = 5.\n\n3. Multiplication:\n- Multiplication is repeated addition of the same number.\n- For example, if you want to multiply 3 by 4, you would write it as 3 x 4.\n- To find the product, add 3 four times: 3 x 4 = 12.\n\n4. Division:\n- Division is splitting a number into equal parts.\n- For example, if you want to divide 10 by 2, you would write it as 10 \u00f7 2.\n- To find the quotient, divide 10 into 2 equal parts: 10 \u00f7 2 = 5.\n\nThese are the four basic arithmetic operations in mathematics. Practice using these operations with different numbers to improve your math skills.",

    "answer": "To solve the equation 3\ud835\udc65^2 - 5\ud835\udc65 + 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that for an equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the roots are given by:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -5, and c = 2.

The natural logarithm function \\( \\ln(x) \\) is defined only for positive real numbers.
